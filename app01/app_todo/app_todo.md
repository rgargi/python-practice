# To-do App

We have a command line task management app which has the ability to add, edit and delete tasks.
The tasks are stored in a text file.

We have a graphical user interface for the task management app. We are using a python third party library (see pypy.org -> FreeSimpleGUI) to create buttons.

The course suggested FreeSimpleGUI, but I am trying with Tkinter as it is a python standard library.

## Issues

x disable add button while editing list
x Edit button errors out when no item from list is selected (used try/except)
x double clicking on the task entry removes all other words (solved by exportselection)
x double clicking on the task entry focuses on entry box (solved by exportselection)
x add scroll bar
